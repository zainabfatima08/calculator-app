# calculator-app
This project is a Python-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app is implemented in two versions:

# Console Version

Run directly from the command line.

Users input numbers and select operations via text prompts.

Continuously asks if the user wants to perform another calculation until they choose to exit.

Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

# GUI Version

Built using Tkinter for a graphical interface.

Features buttons for digits 0-9 and operations +, -, *, /.

Includes an entry screen to display input and results.

Easy-to-use and interactive interface for quick calculations.

# Concepts Covered:

Functions: Modular code for operations and UI handling.

Loops: Repeat calculations until user exits.

Conditional Statements: Operation selection and input validation.

Error Handling: Catch invalid inputs and division by zero.

User Input: Accept numbers and operation choices from users.

# Features:

Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

Dual interface: console and GUI for different user preferences.

Beginner-friendly Python project ideal for learning fundamental programming concepts.
